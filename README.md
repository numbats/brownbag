# Data Science Brown Bag Sessions

## Motivation & Aim

The use of software is generally a necessary, or even primary, component of research in statistics, but often statistically trained individuals are not well equipped or trained deeply on computer science, programming principles or even with handling real data. The main idea of this study group is to be greater than the sum of its parts, that is, rather than learning in isolation, we share knowledge and accelerate our learning â€“ hopefully all while having fun! 

The overarching **aim of this study group is to foster an environment for Monash EBS students to get feedback and ideas from those outside their usual mentoring network (usually their supervisors) on matters related to data science research software, facilitate peer mentoring and network**. The students get an opportunity to present their work concisely (getting the practice they need), teach concepts they learnt and/or learn from others. 


## 2023 S1 Format 

To resume in March 2023.

- 1.5 hour session fortnightly with 30 minutes extra to continue discussions if needed
- Alternate with numbats seminar 
- Try different session types, e.g. hackathon, shut up and write/code, with/without faculty staffs.

## 2022 S2 Format

- The session is one hour long. 
- The session is in-person only at Clayton (for now).
- Two people present each time, each given half an hour block.
- The presentation does not need to be polished. You are encouraged to be informal.
- The topic is chosen by the speaker, who should write the topic below before the session.
- Presentations may assume that the group already has sufficient knowledge in R programming. For those that are not familiar with R, you can learn at https://learnr.numbat.space/. 
- The study group should be deliberately kept small (i.e. no advertising to external bodies) and everyone should adhere to the code of conduct. 
- Each person presents 5-25 minutes on either:
their work with focus on statistical workflow, data and/or software, or 
sharing what they learnt about statistical workflow, data and/or software. 
- If presenting (a) then you are encouraged to present more concisely (5-15 minutes) so it leaves time for discussion and feedback. 
- If presenting (b) then you are encouraged to present longer (15-25 minutes) and should be designed more like a tutorial that is informative with pointers to resources to help individuals learn more. 
- Most presentations should be by students. 
- On the rare occasions that staff present, it should be on (b). 
- Facilitators (who generally should be staff) should ensure the session is running on time and encourage discussion. At closing, facilitators should seek to solicit other topics for discussion in future sessions.

## Code of conduct

Use common sense - be kind and respectful. Criticism should be constructive and designed to improve a student's work.
